# MeadBeginningNodeJS
Starter course for NodeJS and server side programming from Andrew Mead on Udemy - Highly recommend

Sample projects from Andrew Meads Complete Node.js course on udemy. Learn Node.js by building real-world applications with Node, Express, MongoDB, Jest, and more!

This was a really great course and I highly recommend it. This was my first experience with NodeJS and I'm really glad that I took this primer instead of just jumping in. 
There is plenty of content and Andrew has a way of making the information really understandable. I really feel like I have a good grasp on the topic when the challenge comes.
The course was still using much of the commonjs language, so I added a lot of ES6 import/export statements and created ES6 modules. Wherever possible I used destructuring and attempted to use the most "modern" js available.
